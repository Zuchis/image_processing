# image_processing
Welcome to the wonderful world of image processing scripts made in python,
here I will put all the scripts to manipulate images that I've done,
plus I will provide all the images I used to test these scripts. Enjoy! :)

REMINDER:
Probably (and most certainly) all these scripts are already made in one of the million libraries for python out there,
but it is very interesting and recommended to study and make these scripts if you're willing to learn about image
processing and python too, at least for me it's been a really solid and rewarding experience.

Instructions to install Pillow (the library which I use for image processing):

1 - Install this package:
	python-imaging
	with the command:
	sudo apt-get build-dep python-imaging
	(Or the equivalent for your linux distribution)

2 - Install these libs:
	libjpeg8 libjpeg62-dev libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev
	With the command:
	sudo apt-get install libjpeg8 libjpeg62-dev libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev
	(Or the equivalent for your linux distribution)

3- install pillow using pip:
	sudo pip install Pillow
	(if you don't have pip installed, it is probably included in your distro package list, go for it!)
	(Or the equivalent for your linux distribution)

If your pillow instalation was sucessful, you're ready to go, otherwise, well... Linux is a constant wild adventure, so go hunting on the web!

In case you want more information, or you're using Windows, please access the pillow website, there's more than enough info there:
