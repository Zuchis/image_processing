# image_processing
Welcome to the wonderful world of image processing scripts made in python,
here I will put all the scripts to manipulate images that I've done,
plus I will provide all the images I used to test these scripts. Enjoy! :)

Instructions to install Pillow (the library which I use for image processing):

1 - Install these packages:
	build-dep python-imaging
	with the command:
	sudo apt-get build-dep python-imaging

2 - Install these libs:
	libjpeg8 libjpeg62-dev libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev
       With the command:
       sudo apt-get install libjpeg8 libjpeg62-dev libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev
       (Or the equivalent for your linux distribution)
